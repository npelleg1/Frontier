        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <h3>
            Will I need to go to my doctor to be prescribed the right supplements when I get my results?
        </h3>
        <p>
            No, although we always recommend checking in with your doctor if you feel like something
            isn't right. Our Optimization Profiles only contain supplements that are found naturally,
            and can be bought over-the-counter.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How long does it take for my reports to come back?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Thanks to our amazing code team, we have produced an efficient algorithm that can read
            through your pages of raw data and produce detailed Optimization Profiles in minutes!
            Just upload your raw data, grab a snack, and come back to watch the most fundamental
            aspects of your being revealed to you. It's quite the show.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Will I experience any side effects from taking the supplements in the Optimization Profiles?
        </h3>
        <p>
            There is as much risk of a side effect from those supplements as there is from taking
            a vitamin in the morning. Essentially, they are one and the same concept. But again,
            if by any chance you do starting feeling off, do not hesitate to visit your physician,
            and reach out to one of the physicians on our experience team to help you sort it out.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Do you keep my raw data report on file once it has been analyzed?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Absolutely not. We value your privacy and would never take the risk of that information being
            in places you don't want it. As soon as it is analyzed and the Optimization Profiles are created,
            we erase the file from our databases.
        </p>
